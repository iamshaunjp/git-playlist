  <h3> Hi there Net Ninja! </h3>
  <p>
    Just wanted to say huge thanks for your videos on GitHub! You helped me and I'm sure a lot of people who struggle with GitHub at first 'cause it looks so overwhelming and way too complicated.
  </p>
  <p>
    And you broke this down to pretty simple steps just like that!
    Thanks a lot. God bless.

    P.S. here's a pic of random ginger cat from the internet
